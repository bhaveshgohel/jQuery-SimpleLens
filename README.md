jQuery-SimpleLens
=================

This is a simple script to magnify images.
Its parts are the following:
- src/jquery.simpleGallery.js manages a simple gallery with thumbnails and big images.
- src/jquery.simpleLens.js does all the work for the magnifying of the images.
- css/jquery.simpleLens.css provides the css code needed from the magnifying script.

ASAP there will be other information. In the meantime you can view the demo file to check how the script works.
